This is an example README for the Vue-Car-Parking-App-Demo project. This project was created as part of a course I took at [Laravel Daily](https://laraveldaily.com/). Feel free to customize this README file according to your needs and include more information about the project, usage instructions, and any additional relevant details.

## Vue.js Application for Laravel API Course

This is a step-by-step course on how to create a Vue.js application for an existing Laravel API. The example Parking API is taken from the "Build Laravel API for Car Parking App: Step-By-Step" course. In this follow-up course, we're creating a front-end Vue app. Please note that this is not a Laravel SPA, but a front-end course using Vue.js 3. Having front-end knowledge is valuable if your company wants to create separate clients for web and mobile using the same Laravel API.

Here are a few screenshots from the final front-end application:
